what is database? A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

differences between SQL & MYSQL? SQL is also pronounced as the Structured Query Language. It is a fourth-generation programming language. Its purpose is to manage data stored in relational database management systems. It is mainly useful for handling structured data where relations exist between various data entities. while MySQL is an open-source RDBMS developed by MySQL AB and owned by Oracle Corporation. It is a combination of two words – ‘My’ and ‘SQL’. ‘My’ is the name of one of the co-founders Michael Wideness’s daughter and ‘SQL’ stands for Structured Query Language. MySQL is written in C and C++ programming languages. It supports Linux, Solaris, macOS, Windows and FreeBSD operating systems.
